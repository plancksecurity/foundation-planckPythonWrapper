# The names that are in _pEp that DO begin with an underscore, will not be imported into this module, but will be accessible like _pEp._underscore_function().
# They are not directly part of the pEpPythonAdapter API, and are meant to be wrapped in this module.
# Example:
# def underscore_function():
#     _pEp._underscore_function()

# __all__ could be used to limit the symbols exported when using from <pkg> import *
