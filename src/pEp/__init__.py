# pEp package
#
# The names that are in _pEp that do not begin with an underscore, will be be imported into, and "re-exported" from this module.
# They are defined in boost-python/C++, and are directly part of the pEpPythonAdapter API
# The names that are in _pEp that DO begin with an underscore, will not be imported into this module, but will be accessible like _pEp._underscore_function().
# They are not directly part of the pEpPythonAdapter API, and are meant to be wrapped in this module.
# Example:
# def underscore_function():
#     _pEp._underscore_function()
#
# __all__ could be used to limit the symbols exported when using from <pkg> import *
# TODO: Commented out until problems solved
# from pkg_resources import DistributionNotFound, get_distribution

# Imports all symbols EXCEPT the ones beginning with underscore
from ._pEp import *

# import the native module into the current namespace because we also need to access the names beginning
# with an underscore (of _pEp), but we dont want to import them into this module
import ._pEp

# TODO: Commented out until problems solved
# try:
#     __version__ = get_distribution(__name__).version
# except DistributionNotFound:
#     print("Package is not installed.")

# Executed on module import
