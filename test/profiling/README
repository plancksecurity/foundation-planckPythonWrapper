Tool to profile pEpEngine with dtrace.

To profile :

LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/build/lib.macosx-10.11-x86_64-3.4:`pwd`/test python3.4 mp_load_test.py wait_for_debug

wait for Alice instance to respawn after loading 5k keyring, and pass PID to dtrace script

$ sudo dtrace -s profile.d 12345 > log.dtrace

dtrace script does no processing, but just stores event, otherwise it is too slow and drops some events. Events are the analysed with a python script :

$ cat log.dtrace | python3.4 trace_analysis.py > results.txt
